# Ryan Mottahed – Python Daily Exercise – 020818

# 1. Write a statement that concatenates at least two variables (you can have more than 2 for this practice).
# use the string and integer functions, no arithmetic will be allowed for this exercise (i.e. - x*y), 
# combine two variables for a string a variable. The key word here is CONCATENATE.

first = "Hello"
last = "World"
worldnum = 2

print(first + " " + last + " " + str(worldnum))
